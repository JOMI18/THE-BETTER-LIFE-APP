// Creating a user model serves several purposes in software development:

// Data Organization: By defining a user model, you create a structured way to represent user data within your application. This makes it easier to work with user data, pass it around between different parts of the application, and manage it consistently.
// Abstraction: A user model abstracts away the details of how user data is stored or retrieved. Regardless of whether user data comes from a database, an API, or local storage, the rest of your application can interact with it through the user model interface.
// Consistency: By using a user model, you ensure that user data is represented consistently throughout your application. This helps prevent errors and confusion that can arise from using different formats or structures for the same data.
// Encapsulation: Encapsulating user data within a user model allows you to enforce constraints and validation rules on that data. For example, you can ensure that certain fields are always present or that they meet certain criteria (e.g., a valid email address).
// Separation of Concerns: By encapsulating user-related functionality within a user model, you promote separation of concerns in your codebase. This makes your code easier to understand, maintain, and test, as each component is responsible for a specific aspect of the application's functionality.
